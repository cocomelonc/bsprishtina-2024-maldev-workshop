![banner](./BSides-Prishtina-workshop.png)     

The course is divided into four logical sections:    
- Malware development tricks and techniques (classic injection tricks, DLL injection tricks, shellcode running)    
- AV evasion tricks (Anti-VM, Anti-Sandbox, Anti-disassembling)    
- Persistence techniques    
- Cryptographic functions in malware development (exclusive)    
- Android basic malware development and PoC     
- iOS basic malware development and PoC     

Most of the examples in this course require an understanding of the Python and C/C++ programming languages.      

Knowledge of assembly language basics is not required but will be an advantage.

If you not only learn how to write malware but also follow my research, then read my blog; there is a lot of interesting practice-oriented stuff here.
